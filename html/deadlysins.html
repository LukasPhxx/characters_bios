Which makes them real good chatter when it comes to use conversation to gain something, either for themselves or for Hell. They don't care much about how they are, but the way they act is more important, since they saved Hell tons of time, which makes them...kinda hateable from being arrogant and egomaniac about it.</h6>
                                <h6><strong>Ability: </strong>They easily can hypnotize someone if they want by simply chatting, mostly acting up when somoene or themselves talk about wanting something, yes, their power work mostly accidentally for someone accidentally saying, "I want ... ". Something they can also do is make people see the good thing of wanting, simmilar to, pardon me by a poor reference, but simmilar to the Miraculous of the Pig, the gift. The individual will see the good part of wanting something, and will only go off its trance when Makima would like or when the individual reach their goal, even if it harms someone.</h6>
