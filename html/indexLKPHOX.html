But for someone like them, it's not thaat dangerous, their poison is not so strong like the other Toxicroaks, of course, it can cause some slight damage, like a momentary paralysis or even knocking someone out. Not that dangerous that could kill somoene. This caused them to suffer years ago.</h5>

                              <h5><strong><ins>Toriko Butsijima</ins></strong>, a Toxicroak, actually unemployed, but sometimes doing some gigs and deals. Mostly about doing things with his feet/paws, he likes the attention that his stompers gather, ‘‘it's pretty cute~’’ he says. But even though they like this kind of attention, they had to deal with a whole stuff back ago. As being noticeable, he has a Team Rocket tatoo on his leg, over it a tatoo of the Aether Foundation. Back ago, they used to be a Pokémon that Team Rocket kidnapped and used them, although, they didn't knew about this. He only got to know what happened when he found a sweet kind of a person who helped him go through this situation, where this person helped him recover from the wounds he got to keep opening from the past. Now that they are from the Aether, they sometimes go there helping some Pokémons deal with their fears, like a coach, but better. He likes helping those that were in a similar situation that he once was, and yes, Team Rocket mostly abused of his feet/paws since he was a Croagunk, it was totally agains his consent though. But now, they're a new person, a ‘‘new kind of life’’.</h5>
