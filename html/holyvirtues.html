She doesn't have much involvement in Heaven, like her counterpart, the least that she does is greet the newcomers at the very first ring and taking them to the ring that they are going to live their after-life. She also helps couples on being together, doesn't matter the gender. It's a matrimony. That's where comes the fact of her feeling of being not welcome to other rings, because of the weddings she provides to others, and by the fact of being a taboo.</h6>

For him it's a curse, for others it's amazing. But his Precognition works in a low scale as Echo, since his works like a flowing river, he can run into possible futures, so it's not 100% accurate. Killing him of anxiety when the Precognition decides to show itself.</h6>

Even though he has this whole festive and freed atitude, he's very caring about others, which makes him good at solving troubles involving the couples that Echo helps to get married. Mostly offering psychological help or even other kinds of help, mostly involving the sexual attraction from the couples.</h6>

Although, even not talking too much, he's loved by most and hated by some. He cares a lot about the Virtue he represents, so he tries his best to do his job as the governor and representant of his Virtue.</h6>
                                <h6><strong>Ability: </strong>His main ability is a quantity control, being able to manipulate numbers and quantities. Mostly using the four kinds of expressions, adding something to it's size, subtracting something from it's size, multiplying the quantity of something or dividing something into smaller pieces. It is very unusual, but his ability helps a lot with the job he mostly does at the ring he resides.</h6>

                                <h6><strong><ins>Mekhi Adeline</ins></strong>, a Mountain Cat, the governor of The Temperance Ring, reprezenting Zadkiel, the sixth of the Eight Rings of Heaven. His main involvement in Heaven wanders around the Temperance Ring, he host parties for the ones who needs, offering free food and drinks. But not only food, he does the same with stuffs that aren't edible, like, money, treasures, jelwery, clothings, etcetera, etcetera. He does that all with that cold and serious face, sometimes ordering the employees to do such a thing, since he has some kind of a lack of emotions to show off. It's hard for him, since it's the main reason of being hated from some citizens. But what counts for him is the ones who loves him, ignoring the ones who hates him.</h6>
